/**
 * This class is a delegate for nested columns found frequently in the DSL, such as inside the
 * {@code createTable} change.  It can handle both normal columns, as found in the
 * {@code createTable} change, and the {@code LoadDataColumnConfig} columns that can be found in the
 * {@code loadData} change.  When the {@link ChangeSetDelegate} creates a ColumnDelegate for a,
 * given change, it will need to set the correct columnConfigClass.
 * <p>
 * This class also handles the nested where and whereParams elements that appear in the
 * {@code update} and {@code delete} changes.  This probably does not cohere with the overall
 * purpose of the class, but it is much better than having to duplicate the column processing logic
 * since the {@code update} change uses columns and a where clause.
 * <p>
 * This delegate will expand expressions to make databaseChangeLog property substitutions.  It is
 * important that the caller does not do it again.
